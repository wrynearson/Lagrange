Data is infrastructure. It underpins transparency, accountability, public services, business innovation and civil society.



While infrastructure can help mitigate the effects of climate change, so too can data. the Open Data Infrastructure for City Resilience (ODIR) was produced to help city leaders and stakeholders understand how they can better create, use and share data in an open and collaborative way. The project was origninally launched in 2018.



In alignment with the *Making Cities Resilient 2030* campaign by the UN Disaster Risk Reduction, I revamped the project to make it more usable, up-to-date, and innovative. In contrast with the origninal report format, the new resource uses a combination of accessible icons and visuals and a "networked thought" system to filter the components of the project to best fit individual users and interests.
